# ChipotleBot (Independent Project) 
A script using puppeteer and nodejs to order chipotle.

# Version 1.0  
I have an intrinsic love for chipotle. 

# Background
As a student, it's important to always be learning. I went outside my comfort zone, and learned basics of NodeJS and Puppeteer. I then implimented my love for chipotle into a script that does it all with the click of a button. I wanted a simple, and easy, script a user could run to order their choice of toppings, editable in the script, and order to the closest location, with the soonest time.
