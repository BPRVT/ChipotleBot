# ChipotleBot (Independent Project) 
A script using puppeteer and nodejs to order chipotle.

# Version 1.0  
I have an intrinsic love for chipotle. 


# HOW TO USE
As it's set now, the bot orders a burrito bowl with the following toppings to the closest location to you, at the soonest time avaliable: 

CHICKEN, WHITE RICE (EXTRA) BLACK BEANS, TOMATO, SOUR CREAM, CORN (EXTRA), LETTUCE, CHEESE (EXTRA)

This is all editble, to any item on the menu, or anything. See comments on where to change all the following. 

# CAUTION
As it's set now the bot WILL place an order, and charge the default payment method on your chipotle account. 

Be careful, and comment out the submit process if editing / testing anything. 


# Background
As a student, it's important to always be learning. I went outside my comfort zone, and learned basics of NodeJS and Puppeteer. I then implimented my love for chipotle into a script that does it all with the click of a button. I wanted a simple, and easy, script a user could run to order their choice of toppings, editable in the script, and order to the closest location, with the soonest time.
